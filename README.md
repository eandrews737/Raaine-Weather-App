# Raaine

## Introduction

A weather app that finds your location via IP and gives you your local weather. It utilizes a bunch of impressive technologies and APIs. See below for more details.

You can [see the site here](https://eandrews737.github.io/Raaine-Weather-App/)

### Technologies Utilized

* `React` - Javascript framework with live reloading
* `Redux` - Javascript state management library
* `React-Routing` - Router library for react that allows dynamic URLs with react
* `Material UI` - CSS framework created by google for a minimalist aesthetic style
* `Axios API fetching` - Javascirpt library that makes fetching API calls with better security and error handling

### APIs Utilized

* [IP Tracker](http://ip-api.com/json) - Get's the User's coordinates from their IP
* [Dark Sky](https://darksky.net/dev) - Gets the weather information based on their coordinates

## How to Run

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm run test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
