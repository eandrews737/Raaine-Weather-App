# Raaine

A simple weather app I created to demonstrate my React-ive abilities. It utilizes a bunch of impressive technologies.
This includes:

- React
- Redux
- React-Routing
- Material UI
- Axios API fetching (3 different APIs are utilized)

## Available Scripts

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!
