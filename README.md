### Technologies Utilized

* `React` - Javascript framework with live reloading
* `Redux` - Javascript state management library
* `React-Routing` - Router library for react that allows dynamic URLs with react
* `Material UI` - CSS framework created by google for a minimalist aesthetic style
* `Axios API fetching` - Javascirpt library that makes fetching API calls with better security and error handling

### APIs Utilized

`npm start` - start the project. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

`npm run build` - Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
